# openai-discordpy-interactions

Ask anything to OpenAI using Discord slash commands.

---

## Installation

- Change `DISCORD_TOKEN` and `DISCORD_DEFAULT_SCOPE`. `DISCORD_DEFAULT_SCOPE` is ID of your server.
- Change `API_KEYS`. By default it supports two API key because of the limitations of OpenAI's API key usage. In future I might change it to more than two keys

## Requirements

```text
pip install -U discord-py-interactions
pip install -U httpx
```
